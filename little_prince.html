<p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in
    my arms and set out walking once more. <span class="sp1">I felt deeply
    moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was
    carrying a very fragile treasure.</span> <span class="sp2"> seemed to me, even,

    half-smile, I said to myself, again:<span class="sp3"> "What moves me
    so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping
    here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose
    that shines through his whole being like the flame
    of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</span> And I felt
    him to be more fragile still. <span class="sp1">I felt the need of
    protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
    might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</span></p>
