    <h1> Bryce Dinkins</h1>
    <p> Hello my name is Bryce Dinkins(the one in the back middle in the picture) and I am a junior undergrad Computer Science major. I was born in Clinton, Maryland and grew up in the Fort Washinton area. Ever since I was 7 I have been into everything tech related, and that probanly the main reason I chose this major. Currently I am looking for internships in the sofware or game development. Primary school contact: bmdinkins@aggies.ncat.edu</p>
